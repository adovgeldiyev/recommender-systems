Several years later the company contacted him regarding a seemingly impossible problem they were having with one of their multi-million dollar machines. They had tried everything and everyone else to get the machine fixed but to no avail.  In desperation they called on the retired engineer who had solved so many of their problems in the past.The engineer reluctantly took the challenge.  He spent a day studying the huge machine.  At the end of the day he marked a small \"x\" in chalk on a particular component of the machine and proudly stated \"This is where your problem is\".The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again. The company received a bill for $50000 from the engineer for his service.They demanded an itemized accounting of his charges. The engineer responded briefly:One chalk mark                       $1 Knowing where to put it            $49999It was paid in full and the engineer retired again in peace. '"
